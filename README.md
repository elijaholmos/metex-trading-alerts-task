# Metex Trading Alerts Task

## Setup
After you've added the task to your Node, you'll need to configure two task variables:

### TIINGO_TOKEN
1. Navigate to the website https://www.tiingo.com/ and click the "Sign-up" button at the top right of the page
2. Enter a username, email, and password, then click the Sign-up button at the bottom of the form
3. Navigate to the page https://www.tiingo.com/account/api/token. You should see a field containing a random assortment of letters & numbers; this is your Tiingo Token. Copy that value.
4. Paste it into the value for the task's variable called `TIINGO_TOKEN`
